    We'll I'm not a great critic but here's my honest review about what I felt after reading this book.At first I was hesitant to buy the book thinking that it would contain the same unbelievable fictional aspects where the gods can fly and cure the incurable diseases by their touch. I was blown away by the simplicity of the protagonist. He didn't have any powers, instead he had the skill and intelligence which led to his rise to become a Mahadev.The story is well narrated with twists and turns of comedy, drama, rage and emotions which leaves you hooked till you read the last chapter and then, the other two books. The characters are well developed making you feel their pain and happiness.10/10

There's a pretty girl involved but no naughtiness,  just a bit of Bollywood dancing.  The author doesn't describe stuff which is familiar to him, because he knows it - which leaves this outsider scratching his head and wondering what is going on.  Sure, it's fiction, but I'm not very keen. There are tedious chunks of philosophy scattered about.  Every now and then the translator leaves a hindi word untranslated - angvastram, anyone?  Trishul? - which is just irritating.My test in these things is whether I would buy the next book in the series.  No I wouldn't

    This is a really fun book. Amish clearly knows his Hindu/Indian history, tradtions and philosophy. He combines them well to tell a gripping fast paced story of how Shiva in the form of a man, idylically lliving in the Himalays is convinced to help rescue of the Meluhans living in the Indus-Saraswati plains of 4000 years ago. Phrophesised as the \"Neelkanth\", he reluctantly takes on his destiny and embarks on an adventure across the geography of ancient India.The story is peopled by characters and places that many who are conversant with the traiditons of India will be well aware of. The use of Hindu philosphical ideas, and of Sanskrit names and phrases is delicately woven into the story with clear expanation of the context.A good read! Looking forward to the others in the trilogy!

    well  i really liked this book.  India affected Britain in as many ways as Britain did India and its a welcome change to read a story based around the myths (religion dharma) of India.  Shiva is an endeaing character, as is Sita and the weaving of the tapestry around the civili\ations of the people of the land of 7 rivers was  the foundation of a great story Arc.. started reading at midnight last night and just finishing it now.  Now i have to go buy the other 2!

    Its good to see a brave new take on a religious belief/ legend/ myth - plus the everyday lifestyle, the culture and the mores of the advanced and complex Indus Valley civilization was actually intriguingly revealed...a degree of research did come through.  Its the style I have a quarrel with.  Could have been more mature, more subtle...perhaps we will see that in the next book in the trilogy?

I totally disagree, I think what amish has delivered is beyond words and an absolute masterpiece. He has given us something which is at par with lord of the rings and harry Potter series. And if anyone will try to make a movie out of it and if they do it properly with adequate budget, than that will surely surpass everything that Indian film industry has created.Period. Character development is great and description of the city, infrastructure and people's dressing of Meluha is so brilliantly done that it just absorbs you right in and you feel that you are literally experiencing that in a VR or something.

    This is a really fun book. Amish clearly knows his Hindu/Indian history, tradtions and philosophy. He combines them well to tell a gripping fast paced story of how Shiva in the form of a man, idylically lliving in the Himalays is convinced to help rescue of the Meluhans living in the Indus-Saraswati plains of 4000 years ago. Phrophesised as the \"Neelkanth\", he reluctantly takes on his destiny and embarks on an adventure across the geography of ancient India.The story is peopled by characters and places that many who are conversant with the traiditons of India will be well aware of. The use of Hindu philosphical ideas, and of Sanskrit names and phrases is delicately woven into the story with clear expanation of the context.A good read! Looking forward to the others in the trilogy!

    Hello friends,This is the first book of “The Shiva Trilogy” by author Amish.The trilogy’s other two books are”The secret of Nagas” and “The Oath of Vayuputras“All the three titles has gained a great popularity in India…The concept of HINDU god “Lord Shiva” also Mahadev as a common Tibetan is catchy…This book haves 417 pages consisting 26 chaptersThis very first book tells about how Shiva (here a common man) is trying to protect Tribe… And what he does to protect them…All characters are very well crafted and the character of lord shiva is kept very interesting as the lord Shiva is actually described…Immortals of meluha also describes the journey of shiva and his tribe to The MELUHA which was earlier living near a holy lake (Lake Mansarovar)The story is very well crafted… The first book unveils the event ofMysteriously Shiva’s throat turning blue on the consumption of Soma (a drink for long life and good health).Realisation by citizen of Meluha and their king that Shiva is the chosen one…meeting with Sati, daughter of the king of MeluhaA Glimpse of EvilNow in the journey, a feeble assumption of what evil is and who are evil people is made and shiva acts accordingly.Now the question is what will happen next…Is the assumption of true evil correct?Will shiva be able to find what made his throat turn blue?Will he able to find and remove evil out of equation?The book is interesting and indulging… The details of narration complements the beautiful story very well.Various characters are introduced in the first book well, many are told but kept in suspense…My opinion : if you just read this first book, you won’t feel how good this story is… I liked the way story is woven… You’ll realise several distributed parts connecting when you read the whole series (well you’ll realise by the second part

    Amish is really a genius. I've read some reviews on Goodreads that story at the end feels like rushed and sometimes it feels like a bollywood plot. I totally disagree, I think what amish has delivered is beyond words and an absolute masterpiece. He has given us something which is at par with lord of the rings and harry Potter series. And if anyone will try to make a movie out of it and if they do it properly with adequate budget, than that will surely surpass everything that Indian film industry has created.Period. Character development is great and description of the city, infrastructure and people's dressing of Meluha is so brilliantly done that it just absorbs you right in and you feel that you are literally experiencing that in a VR or something. A must read, even for those who are not into reading. Really looking forward to reading the second one.

    I got this thanks to its popularity but unfortunately its a little too dramatic for me, it reads like a script for a Zee TV show which I don't watch but know about thanks to some family members fascinations.......There is no character development, poor scripting, no historical research has gone into this I can presume since their are facts that don't match with what's written along with others........Also Lord Shiva is not an angry God but when he will get angry its the end or so say the Purans but Lord Shiva is perpetually angry in this book, vendetta is raging in his veins, revenge is his middle name and for what......The most off putting thing for me is for Parvati to be described in a sexual way....its too much for me.Sorry but not sorry, this is not my type of reading and I will not recommend this.

    The first part of a trilogy based on Shiva, one of Hinduism's most important gods. Except that in the story he isn't a god, he's just a bloke, who pitches up in India from the far side of the Himalayas.  He turns out to have a blue throat, which is very significant as apparently there is a prophecy about the Neelkanth - someone with a blue throat saving the world.  Unless I dozed through it, we never actually hear the prophecy.It drags a bit - yeah, yeah, he has a blue throat, get on with it.  There's a pretty girl involved but no naughtiness,  just a bit of Bollywood dancing.  The author doesn't describe stuff which is familiar to him, because he knows it - which leaves this outsider scratching his head and wondering what is going on.  Sure, it's fiction, but I'm not very keen. There are tedious chunks of philosophy scattered about.  Every now and then the translator leaves a hindi word untranslated - angvastram, anyone?  Trishul? - which is just irritating.My test in these things is whether I would buy the next book in the series.  No I wouldn't

    The first part of a trilogy based on Shiva, one of Hinduism's most important gods. Except that in the story he isn't a god, he's just a bloke, who pitches up in India from the far side of the Himalayas.  He turns out to have a blue throat, which is very significant as apparently there is a prophecy about the Neelkanth - someone with a blue throat saving the world.  Unless I dozed through it, we never actually hear the prophecy.It drags a bit - yeah, yeah, he has a blue throat, get on with it.  There's a pretty girl involved but no naughtiness,  just a bit of Bollywood dancing.  The author doesn't describe stuff which is familiar to him, because he knows it - which leaves this outsider scratching his head and wondering what is going on.  Sure, it's fiction, but I'm not very keen. There are tedious chunks of philosophy scattered about.  Every now and then the translator leaves a hindi word untranslated - angvastram, anyone?

    This is a really fun book. Amish clearly knows his Hindu/Indian history, tradtions and philosophy. He combines them well to tell a gripping fast paced story of how Shiva in the form of a man, idylically lliving in the Himalays is convinced to help rescue of the Meluhans living in the Indus-Saraswati plains of 4000 years ago. Phrophesised as the \"Neelkanth\", he reluctantly takes on his destiny and embarks on an adventure across the geography of ancient India.The story is peopled by characters and places that many who are conversant with the traiditons of India will be well aware of. The use of Hindu philosphical ideas, and of Sanskrit names and phrases is delicately woven into the story with clear expanation of the context.A good read! Looking forward to the others in the trilogy!

    well  i really liked this book.  India affected Britain in as many ways as Britain did India and its a welcome change to read a story based around the myths (religion dharma) of India.  Shiva is an endeaing character, as is Sita and the weaving of the tapestry around the civili\ations of the people of the land of 7 rivers was  the foundation of a great story Arc.. started reading at midnight last night and just finishing it now.  Now i have to go buy the other 2!

    Its good to see a brave new take on a religious belief/ legend/ myth - plus the everyday lifestyle, the culture and the mores of the advanced and complex Indus Valley civilization was actually intriguingly revealed...a degree of research did come through.  Its the style I have a quarrel with.  Could have been more mature, more subtle...perhaps we will see that in the next book in the trilogy?

    We'll I'm not a great critic but here's my honest review about what I felt after reading this book.At first I was hesitant to buy the book thinking that it would contain the same unbelievable fictional aspects where the gods can fly and cure the incurable diseases by their touch. I was blown away by the simplicity of the protagonist. He didn't have any powers, instead he had the skill and intelligence which led to his rise to become a Mahadev.The story is well narrated with twists and turns of comedy, drama, rage and emotions which leaves you hooked till you read the last chapter and then, the other two books. The characters are well developed making you feel their pain and happiness.10/10

I totally disagree, I think what amish has delivered is beyond words and an absolute masterpiece. He has given us something which is at par with lord of the rings and harry Potter series. And if anyone will try to make a movie out of it and if they do it properly with adequate budget, than that will surely surpass everything that Indian film industry has created.Period. Character development is great and description of the city, infrastructure and people's dressing of Meluha is so brilliantly done that it just absorbs you right in and you feel that you are literally experiencing that in a VR or something.

He combines them well to tell a gripping fast paced story of how Shiva in the form of a man, idylically lliving in the Himalays is convinced to help rescue of the Meluhans living in the Indus-Saraswati plains of 4000 years ago. Phrophesised as the \"Neelkanth\", he reluctantly takes on his destiny and embarks on an adventure across the geography of ancient India.The story is peopled by characters and places that many who are conversant with the traiditons of India will be well aware of. The use of Hindu philosphical ideas, and of Sanskrit names and phrases is delicately woven into the story with clear expanation of the context.A good read! Looking forward to the others in the trilogy!

    We'll I'm not a great critic but here's my honest review about what I felt after reading this book.At first I was hesitant to buy the book thinking that it would contain the same unbelievable fictional aspects where the gods can fly and cure the incurable diseases by their touch. I was blown away by the simplicity of the protagonist. He didn't have any powers, instead he had the skill and intelligence which led to his rise to become a Mahadev.The story is well narrated with twists and turns of comedy, drama, rage and emotions which leaves you hooked till you read the last chapter and then, the other two books. The characters are well developed making you feel their pain and happiness.10/10

    Hello friends,This is the first book of “The Shiva Trilogy” by author Amish.The trilogy’s other two books are”The secret of Nagas” and “The Oath of Vayuputras“All the three titles has gained a great popularity in India…The concept of HINDU god “Lord Shiva” also Mahadev as a common Tibetan is catchy…This book haves 417 pages consisting 26 chaptersThis very first book tells about how Shiva (here a common man) is trying to protect Tribe… And what he does to protect them…All characters are very well crafted and the character of lord shiva is kept very interesting as the lord Shiva is actually described…Immortals of meluha also describes the journey of shiva and his tribe to The MELUHA which was earlier living near a holy lake (Lake Mansarovar)The story is very well crafted… The first book unveils the event ofMysteriously Shiva’s throat turning blue on the consumption of Soma (a drink for long life and good health).Realisation by citizen of Meluha and their king that Shiva is the chosen one…meeting with Sati, daughter of the king of MeluhaA Glimpse of EvilNow in the journey, a feeble assumption of what evil is and who are evil people is made and shiva acts accordingly.Now the question is what will happen next…Is the assumption of true evil correct?Will shiva be able to find what made his throat turn blue?Will he able to find and remove evil out of equation?The book is interesting and indulging… The details of narration complements the beautiful story very well.Various characters are introduced in the first book well, many are told but kept in suspense…My opinion : if you just read this first book, you won’t feel how good this story is… I liked the way story is woven… You’ll realise several distributed parts connecting when you read the whole series (well you’ll realise by the second part

    Amish is really a genius. I've read some reviews on Goodreads that story at the end feels like rushed and sometimes it feels like a bollywood plot. I totally disagree, I think what amish has delivered is beyond words and an absolute masterpiece. He has given us something which is at par with lord of the rings and harry Potter series. And if anyone will try to make a movie out of it and if they do it properly with adequate budget, than that will surely surpass everything that Indian film industry has created.Period. Character development is great and description of the city, infrastructure and people's dressing of Meluha is so brilliantly done that it just absorbs you right in and you feel that you are literally experiencing that in a VR or something. A must read, even for those who are not into reading. Really looking forward to reading the second one.

    I got this thanks to its popularity but unfortunately its a little too dramatic for me, it reads like a script for a Zee TV show which I don't watch but know about thanks to some family members fascinations.......There is no character development, poor scripting, no historical research has gone into this I can presume since their are facts that don't match with what's written along with others........Also Lord Shiva is not an angry God but when he will get angry its the end or so say the Purans but Lord Shiva is perpetually angry in this book, vendetta is raging in his veins, revenge is his middle name and for what......The most off putting thing for me is for Parvati to be described in a sexual way....its too much for me.Sorry but not sorry, this is not my type of reading and I will not recommend this.

But this time after going through first 2 chapters i was deeply engrossed into this book<U+0001F62E><U+0001F60A><U+0001F31F> . I loved the way Shiva was portrayed In here and i liked the author's keenness to details . The characters apart from Shiva was also given the right amount of time in the book and i loved the portrayal of Sati as a brave warrior princess . I liked how their chemistry moved and took the much needed time which was a positive<U+0001F60D> . I loved how nandi , bhadra later known as Veer Bhadra and Brahaspati<U+0001F60A><U+0001F64C> .  The best part about Amish's writing is how he end each chapter .

    The first part of a trilogy based on Shiva, one of Hinduism's most important gods. Except that in the story he isn't a god, he's just a bloke, who pitches up in India from the far side of the Himalayas.  He turns out to have a blue throat, which is very significant as apparently there is a prophecy about the Neelkanth - someone with a blue throat saving the world.  Unless I dozed through it, we never actually hear the prophecy.It drags a bit - yeah, yeah, he has a blue throat, get on with it.  There's a pretty girl involved but no naughtiness,  just a bit of Bollywood dancing.  The author doesn't describe stuff which is familiar to him, because he knows it - which leaves this outsider scratching his head and wondering what is going on.  Sure, it's fiction, but I'm not very keen. There are tedious chunks of philosophy scattered about.  Every now and then the translator leaves a hindi word untranslated - angvastram, anyone?  Trishul? - which is just irritating.My test in these things is whether I would buy the next book in the series.  No I wouldn't

    This is a really fun book. Amish clearly knows his Hindu/Indian history, tradtions and philosophy. He combines them well to tell a gripping fast paced story of how Shiva in the form of a man, idylically lliving in the Himalays is convinced to help rescue of the Meluhans living in the Indus-Saraswati plains of 4000 years ago. Phrophesised as the \"Neelkanth\", he reluctantly takes on his destiny and embarks on an adventure across the geography of ancient India.The story is peopled by characters and places that many who are conversant with the traiditons of India will be well aware of. The use of Hindu philosphical ideas, and of Sanskrit names and phrases is delicately woven into the story with clear expanation of the context.A good read!
